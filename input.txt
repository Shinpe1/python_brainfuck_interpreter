Relearning the art of seeing the world around us is quite simple, although it takes practice and requires breaking some bad habits. And "relearn" is the correct word. Most of us observed much more as children than we do as adults. A child's day is filled with newness and wonder. The desire to explore, to have an adventure, gave us all a natural ability to be aware of the world around us. But as adults we are slow to be stimulated by new ideas and new situations. We fail to see the wonder of the things around us.
The first step in awakening our senses is to rediscover the ability to observe that we had as children. To do so we need to stop anticipating what we are going to see and feel before it happens. Such anticipation blocks our ability to feel.
For example, one chilly night I was on a mountain hike with some students. I told them that we were going to have to cross a mountain stream. They began to grumble about how cold it would be. We reached the stream and they reluctantly plunged ahead. They were almost up to their knees in the water when they realized that I had led them into a hot spring. Later they all said that they had felt cold water at first.
